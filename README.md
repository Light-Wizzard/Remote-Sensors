# Remote Sensors
Remote Sensors are devices that can relay information from a remote location, and have you monitor it and take some type of action depending on the results, as such, in an Industrial or Smart Home application, this is a very interesting subject, I will be using the STM32 Evaluation boards [P-NUCLEO-LRWAN3 STM32 Nucleo starter pack for LoRa](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/stm32-nucleo-expansion-boards/p-nucleo-lrwan3.html), a 4G HAT for Celluar. 

Let me outline the products I will be using for this Project, and what this project will consist of, and how you can use it for your needs.

## Lessions
