# Remote Sensors
Remote Sensors are devices that can relay information from a remote location, and have you monitor it and take some type of action depending on the results, as such, in an Industrial or Smart Home application, this is a very interesting subject, so in this Project I decided to focus on [Waveshare products](https://www.waveshare.com/product.htm), I have no affilation with them other than just being a loyal customer, who wants to show users how to use their product line, so let me outline the products I will be using for this Project, and what this project will consist of, and how you can use it for your needs.

## Motherboard
The Motherboards I will use are based on the Raspberry Pi or Nvidia, I will have separate Wiki pages for each project.

The first board I will talk about is the Compute Module 4 PoE board

I will use the PCI-E to M.2 at Waveshare https://www.waveshare.com/pcie-to-m.2-a.htm
